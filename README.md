# Sink Water Heater

Powers our hot water recirculation system. When turned on,
immediately display temperature of water, and start a timer.

After one minute has elapsed, play a warning beep. Another minute
after that, play a warning beep again. After the third minute
since the device was powered, beep indefinitely.

Device should be **turned off** after consecutive beeping (3 minutes)
have elapsed to avoid permanent damage to the water solenoid.
